# CoffeeMaker

- The CoffeeMaker class simulates a coffee maker system. It initializes a coffee maker instance (MyCoffeeMaker), a recipe book (RecipeBook), and an inventory. It sets up recipes, manages inventory, and checks the possibility of making a purchase based on available ingredients and recipes. Finally, it exits the system. This Java program demonstrates coffee making functionalities and inventory management.
